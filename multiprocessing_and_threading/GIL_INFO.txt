GIL: Global Interpreter Lock
 - a lock that allows only one thread at a time to execute in Python
 - needed in CPython because memory management is not thread safe

 +How to Avoid  GIL:
   -> Use multiprocessing
   -> Use a different, free-threaded Python implementation (Jython, IronPython)
   -> Use Python as a wrapper for third-party libraries (C/C++) -> numpy, scipy
