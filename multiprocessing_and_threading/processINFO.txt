Process: an instance of a program (e.g. Python Interpreter)

+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+ Separate memory space -? Memory is not shared between processes
+ Great for CPU-bound processing
+ New process is stated independently from other processes
+ Processes are interruptable/killable
+ One GIL(Global Interpreter Lock) for each process -> avoid GIL limitation

- Heavyweight
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
- More memory
- IPC (Inter-Process Communication) is complex
