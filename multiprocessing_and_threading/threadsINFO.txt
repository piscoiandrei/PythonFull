Threads: an entity within a process that can be scheduled ( also known
as "light-weight process")

A process can spawn multiple threads


+ All threads within a process share the same memory
+ Lightweight
+ Starting a thread is faster than starting a processs
+ Great for I/O-bound tasks

- Threading is limited by GIL : only one thread at a time
- No effect for CPU-bound tasks
- Not interruptable/killable
- Careful with race conditions (2 or more threads want to modify the same
variable at the same time)
